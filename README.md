# Web Scraping Project

This project involves extracting data from GitHub repositories to analyze open-source trends and generate insights about repository popularity, programming language usage, and contributor activity.

## **Overview**
Using Python and libraries such as `BeautifulSoup`, `Requests`, and `Pandas`, this project scrapes repository data from GitHub, processes it, and visualizes the results to identify trends in the open-source ecosystem.

## **Steps Involved**

### 1. **Problem Definition**
The project aims to answer key questions:
- Which repositories are the most popular based on stars and forks?
- What are the trends in programming language usage?
- How do contributors engage with repositories?

### 2. **Tools and Technologies**
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Web Scraping**: BeautifulSoup, Requests  
- **Data Manipulation**: Pandas, NumPy  
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Automation (Optional)**: Selenium  

### 3. **Web Scraping Process**
- Extracted data points:
  - Repository Name
  - Owner
  - Stars
  - Programming Language
  - Description
- Used pagination to scrape multiple pages of repositories.
- Handled GitHub rate limits using headers and retry logic.

### 4. **Data Cleaning and Analysis**
- Cleaned and structured the scraped data using `Pandas`.  
- Analyzed data to identify popular repositories, language trends, and contribution patterns.

### 5. **Visualization**
- Generated visualizations to present insights, including:
  - Bar charts for programming language usage.
  - Scatter plots for stars vs. forks.
  - Heatmaps for contributor activity.

## **Key Features**
- Efficient web scraping for large datasets.  
- Detailed data cleaning and preparation for analysis.  
- Scalable design with modular functions for reuse.  
- Meaningful visualizations for actionable insights.

## **Challenges and Solutions**
- **Rate Limiting**: Implemented retry logic and exponential backoff.  
- **Dynamic Content**: Used Selenium for JavaScript-rendered pages.  
- **Large Datasets**: Optimized data storage and processing workflows.

## **Future Enhancements**
- Integration with GitHub APIs for more reliable and faster data collection.  
- Real-time dashboards using tools like Streamlit or Tableau.  
- Extended analysis to repository performance over time.
