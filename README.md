# Web-Scraping-Cars24

Our team embarked on a project to web scrape car details from the Cars24.com website,
specifically targeting Tata brand cars in the Mumbai location. This task aimed to extract, clean,
and compile data into CSV files for further analysis. Throughout this process, we gained
valuable experience and faced several challenges, ultimately enhancing our understanding and
skills in web scraping.
